# devop-docker

Exercises and notes written by me when I take the [devops-with-docker 2021 course](https://devopswithdocker.com/) in University of Helsinki.

## [Part 1](https://github.com/hnliu-git/devop-docker/tree/master/exercises/part1)
This part introduces containerization with Docker and relevant concepts such as image and volume. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Run containerized applications
- Containerize applications
- Utilize volumes to store data persistently outside of the containers.
- Use port mapping to enable access via TCP to containerized applications
- Share your own containers publicly
