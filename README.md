# devop-docker

Exercises and notes written by me when I take the [devops-with-docker course](https://devopswithdocker.com/) in University of Helsinki.

## [Part 1](https://github.com/hnliu-git/devop-docker/tree/master/exercises/part1)
This part introduces containerization with Docker and relevant concepts such as image and volume. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Run containerized applications
- Containerize applications
- Utilize volumes to store data persistently outside of the containers.
- Use port mapping to enable access via TCP to containerized applications
- Share your own containers publicly

## [Part 2](https://github.com/hnliu-git/devop-docker/tree/master/exercises/part2)

This part introduces container orchestration with Docker Compose and relevant concepts such as docker network. By the end of this part you are able to:
- Run a group of containerized applications that interact with each other via HTTP
- Run a group of containerized applications that interact with each other via volumes
- Manually scale applications
- Use 3rd party services, such as databases, inside containers as part of your project


## [Part 3](https://github.com/hnliu-git/devop-docker/tree/master/exercises/part3)

This part introduces production-ready practices such as container optimization and deployment pipelines. We'll also familiarize ourselves with other container orchestration solutions. By the end of this part you are able to:

- Critically examine the images that you pull

- Trim the container size and image build time via multiple methods such as multi-stage builds.

- Automatically deploy containers
